# House Hunt

A very barebones, simple application that allows the user to create custom searches for houses, and call these searches using the Domain.com.au API.

The key purposes of this project were to:
* Implement a personal project using NextJS, and gain exposure to pages, API routes, SSG and SSR, as well as TypeScript and Mongo integration
* Create a React frontend using React + TypeScript
* Get some basic familiarity with CSS modules
* Try out some Jest testing using TypeScript, and backend API route testing in NextJS
